## Overview
I prototyped a cutting-edge internal CMS for the Nike R&D team. The prototype is built using React.js and GraphQL and features custom data visualizations designed and developed in P5.js and Three.js. Thatâ€™s all I can tell you publicly due to our agreement with Nike, but please feel free to contact me for more information.
