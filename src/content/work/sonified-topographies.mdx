## Overview

Sonified Topographies was created for UNESCO’s "Beyond City to City" exhibition at the Central Library in Austin, TX. The installation explores global cultures through music, using a custom-built 12K-LED panel array to transform sound into generative landscapes.

The system scrapes the most popular songs in UNESCO Creative Cities and processes the audio through a Processing algorithm, mapping frequencies to evolving 3D visuals. The result is a dynamic display reflecting each city’s unique soundscape.

## My Role

As technical lead, I determined the tech stack, designed the LED installation, and developed the data interface. I collaborated with Seven Mile Media on the artistic concept and designed the generative forms that translate sound into visuals.

## Technical Implementation

**Python for Data Scraping:** Used Python’s BeautifulSoup and Selenium to extract real-time music data efficiently.

**Sentiment Analysis & Color Mapping:** Analyzed lyrics with NLTK and VADER to determine emotional tone and adjust the color palette.

**Generative Visuals in Processing:** Mapped audio channels to 3D landscapes, with peaks and valleys shifting dynamically with the music.

The project transforms music into a real-time visual experience, offering an immersive exploration of global soundscapes and reinforcing the universal power of music and its connection to place and culture.
