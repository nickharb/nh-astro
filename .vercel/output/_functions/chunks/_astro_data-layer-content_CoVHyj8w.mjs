I had to quickly learn the Drupal architecture, onboard a new front-end engineering team, and manage ongoing feature requests from WRI—all while ensuring stability during the transition.\n\n## My Role\nAs lead engineer and technical project manager:\n- Led a team of four: two in-house front-end engineers and two external Drupal engineers.\n- Coordinated with WRI to ensure smooth feature rollouts and deployments.\n- Worked closely with Outright to transfer project ownership without disrupting the development pipeline.\n- Managed client relations, mentored a junior developer, and ensured technical roadmap alignment.\n\n<div class=\"image-layout\">\n  <div class=\"image-full-width\">\n    <Image\n      {...getCloudinaryImageUrl(\"v1742334658/Screenshot_2025-03-18_at_4.36.32_PM_oqjox8.png\", 1200, 600, \"fill\", \"north\")}\n      alt=\"TK\"\n    />\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n## Technical Implementation\n- Drupal & Pantheon: Managed the CMS infrastructure and deployments.\n- React.js & D3.js: Developed and optimized interactive visualizations.\n- SVG-based graphics: Ensured scalable, high-performance data representations.\n- Lando (local dev environment): Streamlined development workflows for engineers.\n\nSystems Change Lab continues to be a powerful tool in tracking global sustainability efforts, providing stakeholders with real-time insights to drive action at the scale and speed needed to protect people and the planet.\n\n<div class=\"image-layout\">\n  <div class=\"image-grid grid-2\">\n    <Image\n      {...getCloudinaryImageUrl(\"v1742334662/Screenshot_2025-03-18_at_4.38.00_PM_p3ytoy.png\", 600, 600, \"fill\")}\n      alt=\"TK\"\n    />\n\n    <Image\n      {...getCloudinaryImageUrl(\"v1742334673/Screenshot_2025-03-18_at_4.38.12_PM_gkzqiq.png\", 600, 600, \"fill\")}\n      alt=\"TK\"\n    />\n  </div>\n</div>","src/content/work/systems-change-lab.mdx","794b14fb83b87e58","wealth-and-mobility-study",{id:105,data:107,body:116,filePath:117,digest:118,deferredRender:16},{title:108,date:109,published:16,client:110,role:111,skills:112,stack:113,image:114,gravity:36,description:115},"Wealth and Mobility Study",["Date","2025-03-10T00:00:00.000Z"],"University of Michigan","Sr. Front-end Engineer","Front-end Development, Data Engineering, Data Visualization, Geospatial","TypeScript, Next.js, Mapbox, Pixi.js, D3.js, MUI, Deno","v1742334560/Screenshot_2025-03-18_at_4.27.11_PM_sp3d0u.png","Mapping inequality and opportunity in the U.S.\n","import { Image } from 'astro:assets';\nimport { getCloudinaryImageUrl } from \"../../utils/cloudinary.ts\";\nimport ProjectInfo from \"../../components/project-info.astro\";\n\n<ProjectInfo frontmatter={frontmatter} />\n\n<div class=\"image-layout\">\n  <div class=\"image-full-width\">\n    <Image\n      {...getCloudinaryImageUrl(\"v1742334560/Screenshot_2025-03-18_at_4.27.11_PM_sp3d0u.png\", 1200, 600, \"fill\", \"center\")}\n      alt=\"TK\"\n    />\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n## Overview\nThe Wealth and Mobility Study, developed for the University of Michigan's Stone Center for Inequality Dynamics (CID), is an interactive data visualization platform that explores wealth inequality and social mobility across the United States. The tool enables users to analyze income and wealth distribution at multiple geographic levels, from states to census tracts, through an intuitive and highly interactive experience.\n\n## The Challenge\nThe project required handling vast amounts of raw data, transforming it into an efficient, structured format that could be seamlessly integrated with Mapbox for geospatial visualization. The application also needed to support dynamic filtering, comparisons, and deep-dive analytics, making performance and usability key priorities.\n\n## My Role\nAs one of two senior front-end engineers, I was responsible for:\n- Developing interactive Mapbox components that allow users to explore income and wealth data across four geographic levels (state, CBSA, county, and census tract).\n- Implementing dynamic visualizations with Pixi.js and D3.js, providing detailed insights into wealth and mobility trends.\n- Optimizing data processing pipelines using Deno, structuring large datasets into a nested JSON format for fast rendering and smooth user interactions.\n\n<div class=\"image-layout\">\n  <div class=\"image-full-width\">\n    <Image\n      {...getCloudinaryImageUrl(\"v1742334566/Screenshot_2025-03-18_at_4.29.52_PM_zdruo1.png\", 1200, 600, \"fill\", \"north\")}\n      alt=\"TK\"\n    />\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n## Technical Implementation\n- Next.js & TypeScript: Built a modern, scalable architecture.\n- Mapbox: Created an interactive mapping interface for geographic wealth analysis.\n- Pixi.js & D3.js: Developed custom high-performance visualizations for deep-dive analytics.\n- MUI: Designed a polished UI for data exploration and user navigation.\n- Deno: Preprocessed raw data into an optimized format for real-time queries and rendering.\n\nThe Wealth and Mobility Study equips researchers, policymakers, and the public with a powerful tool to better understand the dynamics of inequality, fostering informed discussions about wealth mobility and economic justice in the U.S.\n\n<div class=\"image-layout\">\n  <div class=\"image-grid grid-2\">\n    <Image\n      {...getCloudinaryImageUrl(\"v1742334557/Screenshot_2025-03-18_at_4.32.15_PM_tlyoin.png\", 600, 600, \"fill\")}\n      alt=\"TK\"\n    />\n\n    <Image\n      {...getCloudinaryImageUrl(\"v1742334556/Screenshot_2025-03-18_at_4.33.18_PM_msecdo.png\", 600, 600, \"fill\")}\n      alt=\"TK\"\n    />\n  </div>\n\n  <div class=\"image-full-width\">\n    <Image\n      {...getCloudinaryImageUrl(\"v1742334563/Screenshot_2025-03-18_at_4.33.10_PM_c3zhn7.png\", 1200, 600, \"fill\", \"center\")}\n      alt=\"TK\"\n    />\n  </div>\n</div>","src/content/work/wealth-and-mobility-study.mdx","1924181140d335e3","blog",["Map",121,122,138,139],"first-blog-post",{id:121,data:123,body:126,filePath:127,digest:128,rendered:129},{title:124,description:125},"The First Blog Post","Sandwiches have divided us for too long.
